The SPT complex is also composed of SPTLC2 or SPTLC3 and SPTSSA or SPTSSB. Within this complex, the heterodimer with SPTLC2 or SPTLC3 forms the catalytic core. The composition of the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) complex determines the substrate preference. The SPTLC1-SPTLC2-SPTSSA complex shows a strong preference for C16-CoA substrate, while the SPTLC1-SPTLC3-SPTSSA isozyme uses both C14-CoA and C16-CoA as substrates, with a slight preference for C14-CoA. The SPTLC1-SPTLC2-SPTSSB complex shows a strong preference for C18-CoA substrate, while the SPTLC1-SPTLC3-SPTSSB isozyme displays an ability to use a broader range of acyl-CoAs, without apparent preference (By similarity).

The first step of the pathway is the synthesis of the alpha-pyrone moiety by the polyketide synthase dpfgA via condensation of one acetyl-CoA starter unit with 3 malonyl-CoA units and 2 methylations (Probable). The alpha-pyrone is then combined with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) formed by the GGPP synthase dpfgD through the action of the prenyltransferase dpfgC to yield a linear alpha-pyrone diterpenoid (Probable). Subsequent steps in the diterpenoid pyrone biosynthetic pathway involve the decalin core formation, which is initiated by the epoxidation of the C10-C11 olefin by the FAD-dependent oxidoreductase dpfgE, and is followed by a cyclization cascade catalyzed by the terpene cyclase dpfgB (Probable). The short chain dehydrogenase/reductase dpfgG then oxidizes the 8S hydroxy group to a ketone and the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase dpfgH reduces the ketone to the 8R hydroxy group to yield higginsianin B (PubMed:32286350). Higginsianin B is further methylated by the methyltransferase dpfgI to produce the intermediate named FDDP B (PubMed:32286350). The cytochrome P450 monooxygenase dfgpJ then catalyzes a three-step oxidation at C-27 to generate a carboxylic acid as well as C-26 hydroxylation (PubMed:32286350).

Required for histone H4 acetylation at double-strand breaks (DSBs) (PubMed:19234442). Its ability to specifically bind modified histones and chromatin modifying enzymes such as KAT5/TIP60, probably explains its transcription activation activity (PubMed:33938178).

The specific recruitment at scission sites is mediated by membrane receptors like MFF, MIEF1 and MIEF2 for mitochondrial membranes (PubMed:23283981, PubMed:23921378, PubMed:29899447). While the recruitment by the membrane receptors is GTP-dependent, the following hydrolysis of GTP induces the dissociation from the receptors and allows DNM1L filaments to curl into closed rings that are probably sufficient to sever a double membrane (PubMed:29899447). Acts downstream of PINK1 to promote mitochondrial fission in a PRKN-dependent manner (PubMed:32484300). Plays an important role in mitochondrial fission during mitosis (PubMed:19411255, PubMed:26992161, PubMed:27301544, PubMed:27328748).

Catalyzes the third step in the beta-oxidation cycle, namely the reversible conversion of (S)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA to 3-ketoacyl-CoA. Preferentially accepts straight medium- and short-chain acyl-CoA substrates with highest efficiency for (3S)-hydroxybutanoyl-CoA. Acts as 3-hydroxy-2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase in branched-chain amino acid catabolic pathway. Catalyzes the oxidation of 3-hydroxy-2-methylbutanoyl-CoA into 2-methyl-3-oxobutanoyl-CoA, a step in isoleucine degradation pathway.

The cyclooxygenase activity oxygenates AA to the hydroperoxy endoperoxide prostaglandin G2 (PGG2), and the peroxidase activity reduces PGG2 to the hydroxy endoperoxide prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), the precursor of all 2-series prostaglandins and thromboxanes. This complex transformation is initiated by abstraction of hydrogen at carbon 13 (with S-stereochemistry), followed by insertion of molecular O2 to form the endoperoxide bridge between carbon 9 and 11 that defines prostaglandins. The insertion of a second molecule of O2 (bis-oxygenase activity) yields a hydroperoxy group in PGG2 that is then reduced to PGH2 by two electrons.

The cyclooxygenase activity oxygenates AA to the hydroperoxy endoperoxide prostaglandin G2 (PGG2), and the peroxidase activity reduces PGG2 to the hydroxy endoperoxide prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), the precursor of all 2-series prostaglandins and thromboxanes. This complex transformation is initiated by abstraction of hydrogen at carbon 13 (with S-stereochemistry), followed by insertion of molecular O2 to form the endoperoxide bridge between carbon 9 and 11 that defines prostaglandins. The insertion of a second molecule of O2 (bis-oxygenase activity) yields a hydroperoxy group in PGG2 that is then reduced to PGH2 by two electrons. Similarly catalyzes successive cyclooxygenation and peroxidation of dihomo-gamma-linoleate (DGLA, C20:3(n-6)) and eicosapentaenoate (EPA, C20:5(n-3)) to corresponding PGH1 and PGH3, the precursors of 1- and 3-series prostaglandins.

The insertion of a second molecule of O2 (bis-oxygenase activity) yields a hydroperoxy group in PGG2 that is then reduced to PGH2 by two electrons. Similarly catalyzes successive cyclooxygenation and peroxidation of dihomo-gamma-linoleate (DGLA, C20:3(n-6)) and eicosapentaenoate (EPA, C20:5(n-3)) to corresponding PGH1 and PGH3, the precursors of 1- and 3-series prostaglandins. In an alternative pathway of prostanoid biosynthesis, converts 2-arachidonoyl lysophopholipids to prostanoid lysophopholipids, which are then hydrolyzed by intracellular phospholipases to release free prostanoids. Metabolizes 2-arachidonoyl glycerol yielding the glyceryl ester of PGH2, a process that can contribute to pain response. Generates lipid mediators from n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) via a lipoxygenase-type mechanism. Oxygenates PUFAs to hydroperoxy compounds and then reduces them to corresponding alcohols.

Metabolizes docosahexaenoate (DHA, C22:6(n-3)) to 17R-HDHA, a precursor of the D-series resolvins (RvDs). As a component of the biosynthetic pathway of E-series resolvins (RvEs), converts eicosapentaenoate (EPA, C20:5(n-3)) primarily to 18S-HEPE that is further metabolized by ALOX5 and LTA4H to generate 18S-RvE1 and 18S-RvE2.

Preferentially accepts straight medium- and short-chain acyl-CoA substrates with highest efficiency for (3S)-hydroxybutanoyl-CoA. Acts as 3-hydroxy-2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase in branched-chain amino acid catabolic pathway. Catalyzes the oxidation of 3-hydroxy-2-methylbutanoyl-CoA into 2-methyl-3-oxobutanoyl-CoA, a step in isoleucine degradation pathway. Has hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity toward steroid hormones and bile acids. Catalyzes the oxidation of 3alpha-, 17beta-, 20beta- and 21-hydroxysteroids and 7alpha- and 7beta-hydroxy bile acids.

Adaptor protein complexes function in protein transport via transport vesicles in different membrane traffic pathways. Adaptor protein complexes are vesicle coat components and appear to be involved in cargo selection and vesicle formation. AP-2 is involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis in which cargo proteins are incorporated into vesicles surrounded by clathrin (clathrin-coated vesicles, CCVs) which are destined for fusion with the early endosome. The clathrin lattice serves as a mechanical scaffold but is itself unable to bind directly to membrane components. Clathrin-associated adaptor protein (AP) complexes which can bind directly to both the clathrin lattice and to the lipid and protein components of membranes are considered to be the major clathrin adaptors contributing the CCV formation. AP-2 also serves as a cargo receptor to selectively sort the membrane proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis. AP-2 seems to play a role in the recycling of synaptic vesicle membranes from the presynaptic surface. AP-2 recognizes Y-X-X-[FILMV] (Y-X-X-Phi) and [ED]-X-X-X-L-[LI] endocytosis signal motifs within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane cargo molecules. AP-2 may also play a role in maintaining normal post-endocytic trafficking through the ARF6-regulated, non-clathrin pathway. During long-term potentiation in hippocampal neurons, AP-2 is responsible for the endocytosis of ADAM10 (PubMed:23676497). The AP-2 alpha subunit binds polyphosphoinositide-containing lipids, positioning AP-2 on the membrane.

Adaptor protein complexes function in protein transport via transport vesicles in different membrane traffic pathways. Adaptor protein complexes are vesicle coat components and appear to be involved in cargo selection and vesicle formation. AP-2 is involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis in which cargo proteins are incorporated into vesicles surrounded by clathrin (clathrin-coated vesicles, CCVs) which are destined for fusion with the early endosome. The clathrin lattice serves as a mechanical scaffold but is itself unable to bind directly to membrane components. Clathrin-associated adaptor protein (AP) complexes which can bind directly to both the clathrin lattice and to the lipid and protein components of membranes are considered to be the major clathrin adaptors contributing the CCV formation. AP-2 also serves as a cargo receptor to selectively sort the membrane proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis. AP-2 seems to play a role in the recycling of synaptic vesicle membranes from the presynaptic surface. AP-2 recognizes Y-X-X-[FILMV] (Y-X-X-Phi) and [ED]-X-X-X-L-[LI] endocytosis signal motifs within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane cargo molecules. AP-2 may also play a role in maintaining normal post-endocytic trafficking through the ARF6-regulated, non-clathrin pathway. During long-term potentiation in hippocampal neurons, AP-2 is responsible for the endocytosis of ADAM10 (PubMed:23676497). The AP-2 alpha subunit binds polyphosphoinositide-containing lipids, positioning AP-2 on the membrane. The AP-2 alpha subunit acts via its C-terminal appendage domain as a scaffolding platform for endocytic accessory proteins. The AP-2 alpha and AP-2 sigma subunits are thought to contribute to the recognition of the [ED]-X-X-X-L-[LI] motif (By similarity). {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14745134, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15473838, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19033387, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23676497}.",,Alzheimer

Plays a key role in cell positioning and movement in lymphoid tissues: 25-hydroxycholesterol is an intermediate in biosynthesis of 7-alpha,25-dihydroxycholesterol (7-alpha,25-OHC), an oxysterol that acts as a ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor GPR183/EBI2, a chemotactic receptor for a number of lymphoid cells (By similarity). May play an important role in regulating lipid metabolism by synthesizing a corepressor that blocks sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) processing (PubMed:9852097). As an interferon-stimulated gene, has broad antiviral activities against a wide range of enveloped viruses, such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Its product, 25-hydroxycholesterol, activates the ER-localized enzyme ACAT to induce internalization of accessible cholesterol on the plasma membrane and restricts SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated fusion which inhibits virus replication (PubMed:32944968, PubMed:33239446). In testis, production of 25-hydroxycholesterol by macrophages plays a role in Leydig cell differentiation (By similarity). Required to restrain inflammation in macrophages: production of 25-hydroxycholesterol protects macrophages from cholesterol overload, thereby preventing mitochondrial DNA release and subsequent activation of the AIM2 inflammasome (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q4QQV7, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Z0F5, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32944968, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33239446, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9852097}.",,Alzheimer

The cyclooxygenase activity oxygenates AA to the hydroperoxy endoperoxide prostaglandin G2 (PGG2), and the peroxidase activity reduces PGG2 to the hydroxy endoperoxide prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), the precursor of all 2-series prostaglandins and thromboxanes. This complex transformation is initiated by abstraction of hydrogen at carbon 13 (with S-stereochemistry), followed by insertion of molecular O2 to form the endoperoxide bridge between carbon 9 and 11 that defines prostaglandins. The insertion of a second molecule of O2 (bis-oxygenase activity) yields a hydroperoxy group in PGG2 that is then reduced to PGH2 by two electrons. Involved in the constitutive production of prostanoids in particular in the stomach and platelets. In gastric epithelial cells, it is a key step in the generation of prostaglandins, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which plays an important role in cytoprotection. In platelets, it is involved in the generation of thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which promotes platelet activation and aggregation, vasoconstriction and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells.

Note=The disease is caused by variants affecting the gene represented in this entry. HGPS is caused by the toxic accumulation of a truncated form of lamin-A/C. This mutant protein, called progerin (isoform 6), acts to deregulate mitosis and DNA damage signaling, leading to premature cell death and senescence. The mutant form is mainly generated by a silent or missense mutation at codon 608 of prelamin A that causes activation of a cryptic splice donor site, resulting in production of isoform 6 with a deletion of 50 amino acids near the C terminus. Progerin lacks the conserved ZMPSTE24/FACE1 cleavage site and therefore remains permanently farnesylated.

P02649,APOE_HUMAN,APOE,Apolipoprotein E (Apo-E),Homo sapiens (Human),317,"FUNCTION: APOE is an apolipoprotein, a protein associating with lipid particles, that mainly functions in lipoprotein-mediated lipid transport between organs via the plasma and interstitial fluids (PubMed:14754908, PubMed:1911868, PubMed:6860692). APOE is a core component of plasma lipoproteins and is involved in their production, conversion and clearance (PubMed:14754908, PubMed:1911868, PubMed:1917954, PubMed:23620513, PubMed:2762297, PubMed:6860692, PubMed:9395455). Apolipoproteins are amphipathic molecules that interact both with lipids of the lipoprotein particle core and the aqueous environment of the plasma (PubMed:2762297, PubMed:6860692, PubMed:9395455). As such, APOE associates with chylomicrons, chylomicron remnants, very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL) but shows a preferential binding to high-density lipoproteins (HDL) (PubMed:1911868, PubMed:6860692). It also binds a wide range of cellular receptors including the LDL receptor/LDLR, the LDL receptor-related proteins LRP1, LRP2 and LRP8 and the very low-density lipoprotein receptor/VLDLR that mediate the cellular uptake of the APOE-containing lipoprotein particles (PubMed:12950167, PubMed:1530612, PubMed:1917954, PubMed:20030366, PubMed:20303980, PubMed:2063194, PubMed:2762297, PubMed:7635945, PubMed:7768901, PubMed:8756331, PubMed:8939961). Finally, APOE also has a heparin-binding activity and binds heparan-sulfate proteoglycans on the surface of cells, a property that supports the capture and the receptor-mediated uptake of APOE-containing lipoproteins by cells (PubMed:23676495, PubMed:7635945, PubMed:9395455, PubMed:9488694). A main function of APOE is to mediate lipoprotein clearance through the uptake of chylomicrons, VLDLs, and HDLs by hepatocytes (PubMed:1911868, PubMed:1917954, PubMed:23676495, PubMed:29516132, PubMed:9395455). APOE is also involved in the biosynthesis by the liver of VLDLs as well as their uptake by peripheral tissues ensuring the delivery of triglycerides and energy storage in muscle, heart and adipose tissues (PubMed:2762297, PubMed:29516132). By participating in the lipoprotein-mediated distribution of lipids among tissues, APOE plays a critical role in plasma and tissues lipid homeostasis (PubMed:1917954, PubMed:2762297, PubMed:29516132). APOE is also involved in two steps of reverse cholesterol transport, the HDLs-mediated transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver, and thereby plays an important role in cholesterol homeostasis (PubMed:14754908, PubMed:23620513, PubMed:9395455). First, it is functionally associated with ABCA1 in the biogenesis of HDLs in tissues (PubMed:14754908, PubMed:23620513). Second, it is enriched in circulating HDLs and mediates their uptake by hepatocytes (PubMed:9395455). APOE also plays an important role in lipid transport in the central nervous system, regulating neuron survival and sprouting (PubMed:25173806, PubMed:8939961). APOE is also involved in innate and adaptive immune responses, controlling for instance the survival of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (By similarity). Binds to the immune cell receptor LILRB4 (PubMed:30333625). APOE may also play a role in transcription regulation through a receptor-dependent and cholesterol-independent mechanism, that activates MAP3K12 and a non-canonical MAPK signal transduction pathway that results in enhanced AP-1-mediated transcription of APP (PubMed:28111074). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P08226, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12950167, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14754908, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1530612, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1911868, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1917954, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20030366, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20303980, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2063194, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23620513, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23676495, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2762297, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28111074, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30333625, ECO:0000269|PubMed:6860692, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7635945, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7768901, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8756331, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8939961, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9395455, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9488694, ECO:0000303|PubMed:25173806, ECO:0000303|PubMed:29516132}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Through its interaction with HCV envelope glycoprotein E2, participates in the attachment of HCV to HSPGs and other receptors (LDLr, VLDLr, and SR-B1) on the cell surface and to the assembly, maturation and infectivity of HCV viral particles (PubMed:25122793, PubMed:29695434).

It can induce neutrophil chemotaxis, adhesion, can increase the bactericidal activity of neutrophils by promoting phagocytosis via activation of SYK, PI3K/AKT, and ERK1/2 and can induce degranulation of neutrophils by a MAPK-dependent mechanism (PubMed:12626582, PubMed:15331440, PubMed:20103766). Predominantly found as calprotectin (S100A8/A9) which has a wide plethora of intra- and extracellular functions (PubMed:16258195, PubMed:19122197, PubMed:8423249). The intracellular functions include: facilitating leukocyte arachidonic acid trafficking and metabolism, modulation of the tubulin-dependent cytoskeleton during migration of phagocytes and activation of the neutrophilic NADPH-oxidase (PubMed:15331440, PubMed:21325622). Also participates in regulatory T-cell differentiation together with CD69 (PubMed:26296369). Activates NADPH-oxidase by facilitating the enzyme complex assembly at the cell membrane, transferring arachidonic acid, an essential cofactor, to the enzyme complex and S100A8 contributes to the enzyme assembly by directly binding to NCF2/P67PHOX (PubMed:15642721, PubMed:22808130). The extracellular functions involve pro-inflammatory, antimicrobial, oxidant-scavenging and apoptosis-inducing activities (PubMed:19534726, PubMed:8423249). Its pro-inflammatory activity includes recruitment of leukocytes, promotion of cytokine and chemokine production, and regulation of leukocyte adhesion and migration (PubMed:15598812, PubMed:21487906). Acts as an alarmin or a danger associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule and stimulates innate immune cells via binding to pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (AGER) (PubMed:19402754). Binding to TLR4 and AGER activates the MAP-kinase and NF-kappa-B signaling pathways resulting in the amplification of the pro-inflammatory cascade (PubMed:19402754, PubMed:22804476). Has antimicrobial activity towards bacteria and fungi and exerts its antimicrobial activity probably via chelation of Zn(2+) which is essential for microbial growth (PubMed:19087201). Can induce cell death via autophagy and apoptosis and this occurs through the cross-talk of mitochondria and lysosomes via reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the process involves BNIP3 (PubMed:19935772). Can regulate neutrophil number and apoptosis by an anti-apoptotic effect; regulates cell survival via ITGAM/ITGB and TLR4 and a signaling mechanism involving MEK-ERK (PubMed:22363402). Its role as an oxidant scavenger has a protective role in preventing exaggerated tissue damage by scavenging oxidants (PubMed:21912088, PubMed:22489132).

P21554,CNR1_HUMAN,CNR1 CNR,Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB-R) (CB1) (CANN6),Homo sapiens (Human),472,"FUNCTION: G-protein coupled receptor for endogenous cannabinoids (eCBs), including N-arachidonoylethanolamide (also called anandamide or AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), as well as phytocannabinoids, such as delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (PubMed:15620723, PubMed:27768894, PubMed:27851727). Mediates many cannabinoid-induced effects, acting, among others, on food intake, memory loss, gastrointestinal motility, catalepsy, ambulatory activity, anxiety, chronic pain. Signaling typically involves reduction in cyclic AMP (PubMed:1718258, PubMed:21895628, PubMed:27768894). In the hypothalamus, may have a dual effect on mitochondrial respiration depending upon the agonist dose and possibly upon the cell type. Increases respiration at low doses, while decreases respiration at high doses. At high doses, CNR1 signal transduction involves G-protein alpha-i protein activation and subsequent inhibition of mitochondrial soluble adenylate cyclase, decrease in cyclic AMP concentration, inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation of specific subunits of the mitochondrial electron transport system, including NDUFS2. In the hypothalamus, inhibits leptin-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and mediates cannabinoid-induced increase in SREBF1 and FASN gene expression. In response to cannabinoids, drives the release of orexigenic beta-endorphin, but not that of melanocyte-stimulating hormone alpha/alpha-MSH, from hypothalamic POMC neurons, hence promoting food intake. In the hippocampus, regulates cellular respiration and energy production in response to cannabinoids. Involved in cannabinoid-dependent depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI), a process in which depolarization of CA1 postsynaptic pyramidal neurons mobilizes eCBs, which retrogradely activate presynaptic CB1 receptors, transiently decreasing GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission. Also reduces excitatory synaptic transmission (By similarity). In superior cervical ganglions and cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells, inhibits voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels in a constitutive, as well as agonist-dependent manner (PubMed:17895407). In cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells, cannabinoid-induced inhibition of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels leads to vasodilation and decreased vascular tone (By similarity). Induces leptin production in adipocytes and reduces LRP2-mediated leptin clearance in the kidney, hence participating in hyperleptinemia. In adipose tissue, CNR1 signaling leads to increased expression of SREBF1, ACACA and FASN genes (By similarity). In the liver, activation by endocannabinoids leads to increased de novo lipogenesis and reduced fatty acid catabolism, associated with increased expression of SREBF1/SREBP-1, GCK, ACACA, ACACB and FASN genes. May also affect de novo cholesterol synthesis and HDL-cholesteryl ether uptake. Peripherally modulates energy metabolism (By similarity). In high carbohydrate diet-induced obesity, may decrease the expression of mitochondrial dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase/DLD in striated muscles, as well as that of selected glucose/ pyruvate metabolic enzymes, hence affecting energy expenditure through mitochondrial metabolism (By similarity). In response to cannabinoid anandamide, elicits a pro-inflammatory response in macrophages, which involves NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL1B and IL18 secretion (By similarity). In macrophages infiltrating pancreatic islets, this process may participate in the progression of type-2 diabetes and associated loss of pancreatic beta-cells (PubMed:23955712). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O02777, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P47746, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15620723, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1718258, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17895407, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21895628, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23955712, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27768894, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27851727}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 1]: Binds both 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and anandamide. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15620723}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 2]: Only binds 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) with high affinity.

Note=The protein represented in this entry may be involved in disease pathogenesis. May contribute to the development of diet-induced obesity and several obesity-associated features, such as dyslipidemia and liver steatosis, regulating peripheral lipogenesis, energy expenditure and feeding behavior. CNR1 inverse agonists have been shown to reduce body weight and improve metabolic abnormalities in obese subjects, although adverse neuropsychiatric effects, including anxiety, irritability, and depressed mood, halted their therapeutic development (PubMed:18177726). In obese mice, peripherally restricted CNR1 inverse agonists have been shown to normalize metabolic abnormalities, including insulin resistance and fatty liver, and to reverse leptin resistance. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18177726}.; DISEASE: Note=Dysfunction of the endogenous cannabinoid system including CNR1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of central nervous system disorders, including Huntington disease, Parkinson disease, and Alzheimer disease (PubMed:32549916). In post-mortem brains from Huntington disease patients, a progressive CNR1 loss has been observed in the caudate nucleus, putamen, and substantia nigra pars reticulata, and altered expression and abnormal endocannabinoid levels precede motor symptoms in a disease mouse model (PubMed:10828533, PubMed:19524019, PubMed:8255419). In Parkinson disease, low CNR1 expression in mid-superior frontal gyrus and mid-cingulate cortex has been associated with poor mind, poor executive functioning and poor episode memory, while patients with more severe visuospatial dysfunction showed decreased receptor availability in the precuneus, mid-cingulate, supplementary motor cortex, inferior orbitofrontal gyrus and thalamus (PubMed:31342135). In an animal model for Alzheimer disease, CNR1 heterozygous deletion has been associated with decreased levels of postsynaptic density protein 95 (DLG4/PSD95) and accelerated memory impairment, suggesting synaptic dysfunction and a crucial role for CNR1 in the progression of disease symptoms (PubMed:10828533, PubMed:19524019, PubMed:30096288, PubMed:31342135, PubMed:8255419). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10828533, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19524019, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30096288, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31342135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32549916, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8255419}.",Alzheimer

Also induces a very rapid release of large amounts of potassium ions and ATP from muscle cells, which accounts for the pain reaction characteristic of viperid envenomations (PubMed:20660736). The released ATP amplifies the effect of the myotoxins, acting as a 'danger signal', which spreads and causes further damage by acting on purinergic receptors (PubMed:20660736). A model of myotoxic mechanism has been proposed: an apo Lys49-PLA2 is activated by the entrance of a hydrophobic molecule (e.g. fatty acid) at the hydrophobic channel of the protein leading to a reorientation of a monomer (By similarity). This reorientation causes a transition between 'inactive' to 'active' states, causing alignment of C-terminal and membrane-docking sites (MDoS) side-by-side and putting the membrane-disruption sites (MDiS) in the same plane, exposed to solvent and in a symmetric position for both monomers (By similarity). The MDoS region stabilizes the toxin on membrane by the interaction of charged residues with phospholipid head groups (By similarity). Subsequently, the MDiS region destabilizes the membrane with penetration of hydrophobic residues (By similarity). This insertion causes a disorganization of the membrane, allowing an uncontrolled influx of ions (i.e. calcium and sodium), and eventually triggering irreversible intracellular alterations and cell death (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:I6L8L6, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18062812, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1899180, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20660736, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2781572, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7886694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9654096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9839670, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9920486}.",,Alzheimer

The cyclooxygenase activity oxygenates AA to the hydroperoxy endoperoxide prostaglandin G2 (PGG2), and the peroxidase activity reduces PGG2 to the hydroxy endoperoxide prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), the precursor of all 2-series prostaglandins and thromboxanes. This complex transformation is initiated by abstraction of hydrogen at carbon 13 (with S-stereochemistry), followed by insertion of molecular O2 to form the endoperoxide bridge between carbon 9 and 11 that defines prostaglandins. The insertion of a second molecule of O2 (bis-oxygenase activity) yields a hydroperoxy group in PGG2 that is then reduced to PGH2 by two electrons. Similarly catalyzes successive cyclooxygenation and peroxidation of dihomo-gamma-linoleate (DGLA, C20:3(n-6)) and eicosapentaenoate (EPA, C20:5(n-3)) to corresponding PGH1 and PGH3, the precursors of 1- and 3-series prostaglandins. In an alternative pathway of prostanoid biosynthesis, converts 2-arachidonoyl lysophopholipids to prostanoid lysophopholipids, which are then hydrolyzed by intracellular phospholipases to release free prostanoids. Metabolizes 2-arachidonoyl glycerol yielding the glyceryl ester of PGH2, a process that can contribute to pain response. Generates lipid mediators from n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) via a lipoxygenase-type mechanism. Oxygenates PUFAs to hydroperoxy compounds and then reduces them to corresponding alcohols. Plays a role in the generation of resolution phase interaction products (resolvins) during both sterile and infectious inflammation. Metabolizes docosahexaenoate (DHA, C22:6(n-3)) to 17R-HDHA, a precursor of the D-series resolvins (RvDs). As a component of the biosynthetic pathway of E-series resolvins (RvEs), converts eicosapentaenoate (EPA, C20:5(n-3)) primarily to 18S-HEPE that is further metabolized by ALOX5 and LTA4H to generate 18S-RvE1 and 18S-RvE2. In vascular endothelial cells, converts docosapentaenoate (DPA, C22:5(n-3)) to 13R-HDPA, a precursor for 13-series resolvins (RvTs) shown to activate macrophage phagocytosis during bacterial infection. In activated leukocytes, contributes to oxygenation of hydroxyeicosatetraenoates (HETE) to diHETES (5,15-diHETE and 5,11-diHETE). Can also use linoleate (LA, (9Z,12Z)-octadecadienoate, C18:2(n-6)) as substrate and produce hydroxyoctadecadienoates (HODEs) in a regio- and stereospecific manner, being (9R)-HODE ((9R)-hydroxy-(10E,12Z)-octadecadienoate) and (13S)-HODE ((13S)-hydroxy-(9Z,11E)-octadecadienoate) its major products (By similarity).

Part of the L-cysteine derived from the trans-sulfuration pathway is utilized for biosynthesis of the ubiquitous antioxidant glutathione (PubMed:18476726). Besides its role in the conversion of L-cystathionine into L-cysteine, it utilizes L-cysteine and L-homocysteine as substrates (at much lower rates than L,L-cystathionine) to produce the endogenous gaseous signaling molecule hydrogen sulfide (H2S) (PubMed:10212249, PubMed:19019829, PubMed:19261609, PubMed:19961860). In vitro, it converts two L-cysteine molecules into lanthionine and H2S, also two L-homocysteine molecules to homolanthionine and H2S, which can be particularly relevant under conditions of severe hyperhomocysteinemia (which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease) (PubMed:19261609). Lanthionine and homolanthionine are structural homologs of L,L-cystathionine that differ by the absence or presence of an extra methylene group, respectively (PubMed:19261609).

Adaptor protein complexes function in protein transport via transport vesicles in different membrane traffic pathways. Adaptor protein complexes are vesicle coat components and appear to be involved in cargo selection and vesicle formation. AP-2 is involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis in which cargo proteins are incorporated into vesicles surrounded by clathrin (clathrin-coated vesicles, CCVs) which are destined for fusion with the early endosome. The clathrin lattice serves as a mechanical scaffold but is itself unable to bind directly to membrane components. Clathrin-associated adaptor protein (AP) complexes which can bind directly to both the clathrin lattice and to the lipid and protein components of membranes are considered to be the major clathrin adaptors contributing the CCV formation. AP-2 also serves as a cargo receptor to selectively sort the membrane proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis. AP-2 seems to play a role in the recycling of synaptic vesicle membranes from the presynaptic surface. AP-2 recognizes Y-X-X-[FILMV] (Y-X-X-Phi) and [ED]-X-X-X-L-[LI] endocytosis signal motifs within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane cargo molecules. AP-2 may also play a role in maintaining normal post-endocytic trafficking through the ARF6-regulated, non-clathrin pathway. During long-term potentiation in hippocampal neurons, AP-2 is responsible for the endocytosis of ADAM10 (PubMed:23676497). The AP-2 beta subunit acts via its C-terminal appendage domain as a scaffolding platform for endocytic accessory proteins; at least some clathrin-associated sorting proteins (CLASPs) are recognized by their [DE]-X(1,2)-F-X-X-[FL]-X-X-X-R motif. The AP-2 beta subunit binds to clathrin heavy chain, promoting clathrin lattice assembly; clathrin displaces at least some CLASPs from AP2B1 which probably then can be positioned for further coat assembly. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14745134, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14985334, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15473838, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19033387, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23676497}.",,Alzheimer

The cyclooxygenase activity oxygenates AA to the hydroperoxy endoperoxide prostaglandin G2 (PGG2), and the peroxidase activity reduces PGG2 to the hydroxy endoperoxide prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), the precursor of all 2-series prostaglandins and thromboxanes. This complex transformation is initiated by abstraction of hydrogen at carbon 13 (with S-stereochemistry), followed by insertion of molecular O2 to form the endoperoxide bridge between carbon 9 and 11 that defines prostaglandins. The insertion of a second molecule of O2 (bis-oxygenase activity) yields a hydroperoxy group in PGG2 that is then reduced to PGH2 by two electrons. Similarly catalyzes successive cyclooxygenation and peroxidation of dihomo-gamma-linoleate (DGLA, C20:3(n-6)) and eicosapentaenoate (EPA, C20:5(n-3)) to corresponding PGH1 and PGH3, the precursors of 1- and 3-series prostaglandins.

Adaptor protein complexes function in protein transport via transport vesicles in different membrane traffic pathways (PubMed:14745134, PubMed:15473838). Adaptor protein complexes are vesicle coat components and appear to be involved in cargo selection and vesicle formation (PubMed:14745134, PubMed:15473838). AP-2 is involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis in which cargo proteins are incorporated into vesicles surrounded by clathrin (clathrin-coated vesicles, CCVs) which are destined for fusion with the early endosome (PubMed:14745134, PubMed:15473838). The clathrin lattice serves as a mechanical scaffold but is itself unable to bind directly to membrane components (PubMed:14745134, PubMed:15473838). Clathrin-associated adaptor protein (AP) complexes which can bind directly to both the clathrin lattice and to the lipid and protein components of membranes are considered to be the major clathrin adaptors contributing the CCV formation (By similarity). AP-2 also serves as a cargo receptor to selectively sort the membrane proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis (By similarity). AP-2 seems to play a role in the recycling of synaptic vesicle membranes from the presynaptic surface (By similarity). AP-2 recognizes Y-X-X-[FILMV] (Y-X-X-Phi) and [ED]-X-X-X-L-[LI] endocytosis signal motifs within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane cargo molecules (By similarity).

During long-term potentiation in hippocampal neurons, AP-2 is responsible for the endocytosis of ADAM10 (PubMed:23676497). The AP-2 mu subunit binds to transmembrane cargo proteins; it recognizes the Y-X-X-Phi motifs (By similarity). The surface region interacting with to the Y-X-X-Phi motif is inaccessible in cytosolic AP-2, but becomes accessible through a conformational change following phosphorylation of AP-2 mu subunit at Thr-156 in membrane-associated AP-2 (By similarity).

In the mature central nervous system (CNS), regulates neurotransmitter movements by phosphorylating substrates associated with neurotransmitter release and synapse plasticity; synaptic vesicle exocytosis, vesicles fusion with the presynaptic membrane, and endocytosis. Promotes cell survival by activating anti-apoptotic proteins BCL2 and STAT3, and negatively regulating of JNK3/MAPK10 activity. Phosphorylation of p53/TP53 in response to genotoxic and oxidative stresses enhances its stabilization by preventing ubiquitin ligase-mediated proteasomal degradation, and induces transactivation of p53/TP53 target genes, thus regulating apoptosis. Phosphorylation of p35/CDK5R1 enhances its stabilization by preventing calpain-mediated proteolysis producing p25/CDK5R1 and avoiding ubiquitin ligase-mediated proteasomal degradation. During aberrant cell-cycle activity and DNA damage, p25/CDK5 activity elicits cell-cycle activity and double-strand DNA breaks that precedes neuronal death by deregulating HDAC1.

Isoform 2 anti-apoptotic activity is mediated by inhibition of the GZMA-activated DNase, NME1. In the course of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-induced apoptosis, GZMA cleaves SET, disrupting its binding to NME1 and releasing NME1 inhibition. Isoform 1 and isoform 2 are potent inhibitors of protein phosphatase 2A. Isoform 1 and isoform 2 inhibit EP300/CREBBP and PCAF-mediated acetylation of histones (HAT) and nucleosomes, most probably by masking the accessibility of lysines of histones to the acetylases. The predominant target for inhibition is histone H4. HAT inhibition leads to silencing of HAT-dependent transcription and prevents active demethylation of DNA. Both isoforms stimulate DNA replication of the adenovirus genome complexed with viral core proteins; however, isoform 2 specific activity is higher. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11555662, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12628186}.","DISEASE: Note=A chromosomal aberration involving SET is found in some cases of acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL).

The cyclooxygenase activity oxygenates arachidonate (AA, C20:4(n-6)) to the hydroperoxy endoperoxide prostaglandin G2 (PGG2), and the peroxidase activity reduces PGG2 to the hydroxy endoperoxide PGH2, the precursor of all 2-series prostaglandins and thromboxanes. This complex transformation is initiated by abstraction of hydrogen at carbon 13 (with S-stereochemistry), followed by insertion of molecular O2 to form the endoperoxide bridge between carbon 9 and 11 that defines prostaglandins. The insertion of a second molecule of O2 (bis-oxygenase activity) yields a hydroperoxy group in PGG2 that is then reduced to PGH2 by two electrons (PubMed:12925531, PubMed:20463020, PubMed:20810665, PubMed:21489986, PubMed:22942274).

Metabolizes docosahexaenoate (DHA, C22:6(n-3)) to 17R-HDHA, a precursor of the D-series resolvins (RvDs). As a component of the biosynthetic pathway of E-series resolvins (RvEs), converts eicosapentaenoate (EPA, C20:5(n-3)) primarily to 18S-HEPE that is further metabolized by ALOX5 and LTA4H to generate 18S-RvE1 and 18S-RvE2.

Together with p115/USO1 and STX5, involved in vesicle tethering and fusion at the cis-Golgi membrane to maintain the stacked and inter-connected structure of the Golgi apparatus.

Also plays a key role in spindle pole assembly and centrosome organization (PubMed:26165940). Promotes the mitotic spindle pole assembly by activating the spindle assembly factor TPX2 to nucleate microtubules around the Golgi and capture them to couple mitotic membranes to the spindle: upon phosphorylation at the onset of mitosis, GOLGA2 interacts with importin-alpha via the nuclear localization signal region, leading to recruit importin-alpha to the Golgi membranes and liberate the spindle assembly factor TPX2 from importin-alpha. TPX2 then activates AURKA kinase and stimulates local microtubule nucleation. Upon filament assembly, nascent microtubules are further captured by GOLGA2, thus linking Golgi membranes to the spindle (PubMed:19242490, PubMed:26165940).

Restricts the expression of neuronal genes by associating with two distinct corepressors, SIN3A and RCOR1, which in turn recruit histone deacetylase to the promoters of REST-regulated genes (PubMed:10449787, PubMed:10734093). Mediates repression by recruiting the BHC complex at RE1/NRSE sites which acts by deacetylating and demethylating specific sites on histones, thereby acting as a chromatin modifier (By similarity). Transcriptional repression by REST-CDYL via the recruitment of histone methyltransferase EHMT2 may be important in transformation suppression (PubMed:19061646). Represses the expression of SRRM4 in non-neural cells to prevent the activation of neural-specific splicing events and to prevent production of REST isoform 3 (By similarity).

Contributes to the regulation of the fast action potential repolarization and in sustained high-frequency firing in neurons of the central nervous system (PubMed:10414303, PubMed:10561420, PubMed:10903572, PubMed:11124984, PubMed:11506885, PubMed:15317859, PubMed:15917463, PubMed:17761775, PubMed:21414897). Homotetramer channels mediate delayed-rectifier voltage-dependent potassium currents that activate rapidly at high-threshold voltages and inactivate slowly (PubMed:10414303, PubMed:10561420, PubMed:10903572, PubMed:15317859). Forms tetrameric channels through which potassium ions pass in accordance with their electrochemical gradient. The channel alternates between opened and closed conformations in response to the voltage difference across the membrane (By similarity). Can form functional homotetrameric and heterotetrameric channels that contain variable proportions of KCNC1, and possibly other family members as well; channel properties depend on the type of alpha subunits that are part of the channel (PubMed:10531438, PubMed:12000114). Channel properties may be modulated by either the association with ancillary subunits, such as KCNE1, KCNE2 and KCNE3 or indirectly by nitric oxide (NO) through a cGMP- and PKG-mediated signaling cascade, slowing channel activation and deactivation of delayed rectifier potassium channels (By similarity).

Sustained maximal action potential firing frequency in inhibitory hippocampal interneurons is negatively modulated by histamine H2 receptor activation in a cAMP- and protein kinase (PKA) phosphorylation-dependent manner (PubMed:10903572). Plays a role in maintaining the fidelity of synaptic transmission in neocortical GABAergic interneurons by generating action potential (AP) repolarization at nerve terminals, thus reducing spike-evoked calcium influx and GABA neurotransmitter release (PubMed:15917463).

Advanced glycosylation end products are nonenzymatically glycosylated proteins which accumulate in vascular tissue in aging and at an accelerated rate in diabetes (PubMed:21565706). These ligands accumulate at inflammatory sites during the pathogenesis of various diseases including diabetes, vascular complications, neurodegenerative disorders and cancers, and RAGE transduces their binding into pro-inflammatory responses. Upon ligand binding, uses TIRAP and MYD88 as adapters to transduce the signal ultimately leading to the induction of inflammatory cytokines IL6, IL8 and TNFalpha through activation of NF-kappa-B (PubMed:21829704, PubMed:33436632). Interaction with S100A12 on endothelium, mononuclear phagocytes, and lymphocytes triggers cellular activation, with generation of key pro-inflammatory mediators (PubMed:19386136). Interaction with S100B after myocardial infarction may play a role in myocyte apoptosis by activating ERK1/2 and p53/TP53 signaling (By similarity). Contributes to the translocation of amyloid-beta peptide (ABPP) across the cell membrane from the extracellular to the intracellular space in cortical neurons (PubMed:19906677). ABPP-initiated RAGE signaling, especially stimulation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), has the capacity to drive a transport system delivering ABPP as a complex with RAGE to the intraneuronal space. Participates in endothelial albumin transcytosis together with HMGB1 through the RAGE/SRC/Caveolin-1 pathway, leading to endothelial hyperpermeability (PubMed:27572515). Mediates the loading of HMGB1 in extracellular vesicles (EVs) that shuttle HMGB1 to hepatocytes by transferrin-mediated endocytosis and subsequently promote hepatocyte pyroptosis by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome (PubMed:34743181). Binds to DNA and promotes extracellular hypomethylated DNA (CpG DNA) uptake by cells via the endosomal route to activate inflammatory responses (PubMed:24081950, PubMed:28515150).

Transduces the activin signal from the cell surface to the cytoplasm and is thus regulating a many physiological and pathological processes including neuronal differentiation and neuronal survival, hair follicle development and cycling, FSH production by the pituitary gland, wound healing, extracellular matrix production, immunosuppression and carcinogenesis. Activin is also thought to have a paracrine or autocrine role in follicular development in the ovary. Within the receptor complex, type-2 receptors (ACVR2A and/or ACVR2B) act as a primary activin receptors whereas the type-1 receptors like ACVR1B act as downstream transducers of activin signals. Activin binds to type-2 receptor at the plasma membrane and activates its serine-threonine kinase. The activated receptor type-2 then phosphorylates and activates the type-1 receptor such as ACVR1B. Once activated, the type-1 receptor binds and phosphorylates the SMAD proteins SMAD2 and SMAD3, on serine residues of the C-terminal tail. Soon after their association with the activin receptor and subsequent phosphorylation, SMAD2 and SMAD3 are released into the cytoplasm where they interact with the common partner SMAD4. This SMAD complex translocates into the nucleus where it mediates activin-induced transcription. Inhibitory SMAD7, which is recruited to ACVR1B through FKBP1A, can prevent the association of SMAD2 and SMAD3 with the activin receptor complex, thereby blocking the activin signal.

Adaptor protein complexes function in protein transport via transport vesicles in different membrane traffic pathways. Adaptor protein complexes are vesicle coat components and appear to be involved in cargo selection and vesicle formation. AP-2 is involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis in which cargo proteins are incorporated into vesicles surrounded by clathrin (clathrin-coated vesicles, CCVs) which are destined for fusion with the early endosome. The clathrin lattice serves as a mechanical scaffold but is itself unable to bind directly to membrane components. Clathrin-associated adaptor protein (AP) complexes which can bind directly to both the clathrin lattice and to the lipid and protein components of membranes are considered to be the major clathrin adaptors contributing the CCV formation. AP-2 also serves as a cargo receptor to selectively sort the membrane proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis. AP-2 seems to play a role in the recycling of synaptic vesicle membranes from the presynaptic surface. AP-2 recognizes Y-X-X-[FILMV] (Y-X-X-Phi) and [ED]-X-X-X-L-[LI] endocytosis signal motifs within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane cargo molecules. AP-2 may also play a role in maintaining normal post-endocytic trafficking through the ARF6-regulated, non-clathrin pathway. During long-term potentiation in hippocampal neurons, AP-2 is responsible for the endocytosis of ADAM10 (PubMed:23676497). The AP-2 beta subunit acts via its C-terminal appendage domain as a scaffolding platform for endocytic accessory proteins; at least some clathrin-associated sorting proteins (CLASPs) are recognized by their [DE]-X(1,2)-F-X-X-[FL]-X-X-X-R motif. The AP-2 beta subunit binds to clathrin heavy chain, promoting clathrin lattice assembly; clathrin displaces at least some CLASPs from AP2B1 which probably then can be positioned for further coat assembly (By similarity). {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14745134, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15473838, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23676497}.",,Alzheimer

The quinolone-gamma-lactam hybrid scaffold is synthesized from the combination of L-isoleucine (L-Ile) and the nonproteinogenic amino acid L-kynurenine, followed by quinolone cyclization, oxidative decarboxylation, and lactam formation (PubMed:32663343). Additionally, the N-methyl group is derived from methionine, which might be catalyzed by an S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase (PubMed:32663343). Bioconversion of L-tryptophan to L-kynurenine could be catalyzed by the indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) qulI to produce an unstable product, N-formyl-L-kynurenine, followed by kynurenine formamidase catalyzed hydrolysis (PubMed:32663343). QulM then acts as a methyltransferase that methylates L-kynurenine at the N-4 position (PubMed:32663343). The FMN-dependent alpha-hydroxy acid dehydrogenase qulF than functions as an oxidative decarboxylase which converts N-methylkynurenine into 2-aminobenzoylacetamide via 2 tandem reactions, including dehydrogenation and decarboxylation (PubMed:32663343). An amidase located outside of the qul gene cluster further produces the unstable beta-keto acid precursor N-methyl-2-aminobenzoylacetate, which could be spontaneously dehydrated to form N-methyl-4-hydroxy-2-quinolone (PubMed:32663343). The NRPS qulB is able to incorporate N-methyl-2-aminobenzoylacetate and efficiently compete with the spontaneous reaction (PubMed:32663343). By further extending the beta-keto acid with L-Ile, qulA performs a Dieckmann condensation to form the gamma-lactam ring and release a 4-ketopyrrolidinone intermediate from the assembly line (PubMed:32663343). This intermediate could plausibly further undergo a spontaneous cyclization to yield the final quinolone-gamma-lactam hybrid structure (PubMed:32663343). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:32663343}.",,Alzheimer

It also acts on sodium channels of both insects and mammals (PubMed:26747232). On sodium channel insects, it strongly slows down channel inactivation (EC(50)=212.5 nM) and causes an increase (105%) in peak amplitude (at 1 uM) of B.germanica sodium channel (Nav), whereas it inhibits all mammalien sodium channels tested with the following order of potency: Nav1.3/SCN3A (IC(50)=1.5 uM) > Nav1.6/SCN8A > Nav1.5/SCN5A > Nav1.4/SCN4A >= Nav1.2/SCN2A (PubMed:26747232).

The first step of the pathway is the synthesis of the alpha-pyrone moiety by the polyketide synthase dpfgA via condensation of one acetyl-CoA starter unit with 3 malonyl-CoA units and 2 methylations (Probable). The alpha-pyrone is then combined with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) formed by the GGPP synthase dpfgD through the action of the prenyltransferase dpfgC to yield a linear alpha-pyrone diterpenoid (Probable). Subsequent steps in the diterpenoid pyrone biosynthetic pathway involve the decalin core formation, which is initiated by the epoxidation of the C10-C11 olefin by the FAD-dependent oxidoreductase dpfgE, and is followed by a cyclization cascade catalyzed by the terpene cyclase dpfgB (Probable).

The molecular scaffold is commonly biosynthesized by a series of enzymes including the non-reducing polyketide synthase (NR-PKS) esdpA that generates an alpha-pyrone; the prenyltransferase esdpC that attaches a geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) produced by the GGPP synthase (GGPPS) esdpD onto the pyrone unit; the FAD-dependent monooxygenase esdpE that converts an olefin on the diterpene unit into an epoxide; and the terpene cyclase esdpB that catalyzes the cyclization reactions to give the molecular backbone shearone A (PubMed:35057611). In the modification steps, esdpF oxidizes the hydroxy group to a ketone at C-3 and esdpG then attaches hydroxy groups at both C-11 and C-12.

The quinolone-gamma-lactam hybrid scaffold is synthesized from the combination of L-isoleucine (L-Ile) and the nonproteinogenic amino acid L-kynurenine, followed by quinolone cyclization, oxidative decarboxylation, and lactam formation (PubMed:32663343). Additionally, the N-methyl group is derived from methionine, which might be catalyzed by an S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase (PubMed:32663343). Bioconversion of L-tryptophan to L-kynurenine could be catalyzed by the indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) qulI to produce an unstable product, N-formyl-L-kynurenine, followed by kynurenine formamidase catalyzed hydrolysis (PubMed:32663343). QulM then acts as a methyltransferase that methylates L-kynurenine at the N-4 position (PubMed:32663343). The FMN-dependent alpha-hydroxy acid dehydrogenase qulF than functions as an oxidative decarboxylase which converts N-methylkynurenine into 2-aminobenzoylacetamide via 2 tandem reactions, including dehydrogenation and decarboxylation (PubMed:32663343). An amidase located outside of the qul gene cluster further produces the unstable beta-keto acid precursor N-methyl-2-aminobenzoylacetate, which could be spontaneously dehydrated to form N-methyl-4-hydroxy-2-quinolone (PubMed:32663343). The NRPS qulB is able to incorporate N-methyl-2-aminobenzoylacetate and efficiently compete with the spontaneous reaction (PubMed:32663343). By further extending the beta-keto acid with L-Ile, qulA performs a Dieckmann condensation to form the gamma-lactam ring and release a 4-ketopyrrolidinone intermediate from the assembly line (PubMed:32663343). This intermediate could plausibly further undergo a spontaneous cyclization to yield the final quinolone-gamma-lactam hybrid structure (PubMed:32663343). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:32663343}.",,Alzheimer

Essential component of the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAP/JNK) signaling pathway. With MAP2K4/MKK4, is the one of the only known kinase to directly activate the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinases MAPK8/JNK1, MAPK9/JNK2 and MAPK10/JNK3. MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7 both activate the JNKs by phosphorylation, but they differ in their preference for the phosphorylation site in the Thr-Pro-Tyr motif.

Finally, APOE also has a heparin-binding activity and binds heparan-sulfate proteoglycans on the surface of cells, a property that supports the capture and the receptor-mediated uptake of APOE-containing lipoproteins by cells. A main function of APOE is to mediate lipoprotein clearance through the uptake of chylomicrons, VLDLs, and HDLs by hepatocytes.

Along with AP-1 complex, involved Golgi apparatus - endosome sorting. Sorting receptor for APP, regulating its intracellular trafficking and processing into amyloidogenic-beta peptides. Retains APP in the trans-Golgi network, hence preventing its transit through late endosomes where amyloid beta peptides Abeta40 and Abeta42 are generated. May also sort newly produced amyloid-beta peptides to lysosomes for catabolism. Does not affect APP trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi compartments. Sorting receptor for the BDNF receptor NTRK2/TRKB that facilitates NTRK2 trafficking between synaptic plasma membranes, postsynaptic densities and cell soma, hence positively regulates BDNF signaling by controlling the intracellular location of its receptor (By similarity). Sorting receptor for GDNF that promotes GDNF regulated, but not constitutive secretion (PubMed:21994944). Sorting receptor for the GDNF-GFRA1 complex, directing it from the cell surface to endosomes. GDNF is then targeted to lysosomes and degraded, while its receptor GFRA1 recycles back to the cell membrane, resulting in a GDNF clearance pathway. The SORL1-GFRA1 complex further targets RET for endocytosis, but not for degradation, affecting GDNF-induced neurotrophic activities (PubMed:23333276). Sorting receptor for ERBB2/HER2. Regulates ERBB2 subcellular distribution by promoting its recycling after internalization from endosomes back to the plasma membrane, hence stimulating phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent ERBB2 signaling (By similarity). Sorting receptor for lipoprotein lipase LPL. Promotes LPL localization to endosomes and later to the lysosomes, leading to degradation of newly synthesized LPL. Potential sorting receptor for APOA5, inducing APOA5 internalization to early endosomes, then to late endosomes, wherefrom a portion is sent to lysosomes and degradation, another portion is sorted to the trans-Golgi network. Sorting receptor for the insulin receptor INSR. Promotes recycling of internalized INSR via the Golgi apparatus back to the cell surface, thereby preventing lysosomal INSR catabolism, increasing INSR cell surface expression and strengthening insulin signal reception in adipose tissue. Does not affect INSR internalization (By similarity). Plays a role in renal ion homeostasis, controlling the phospho-regulation of SLC12A1/NKCC2 by STK39/SPAK kinase and PPP3CB/calcineurin A beta phosphatase, possibly through intracellular sorting of STK39 and PPP3CB (PubMed:25967121). Stimulates, via the N-terminal ectodomain, the proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells, possibly by increasing cell surface expression of the urokinase receptor uPAR/PLAUR. This may promote extracellular matrix proteolysis and hence facilitate cell migration. By acting on the migration of intimal smooth muscle cells, may accelerate intimal thickening following vascular injury (By similarity). Stimulates proliferation and migration monocytes/macrophages. Through its action on intimal smooth muscle cells and macrophages, may accelerate intimal thickening and macrophage foam cell formation in the process of atherosclerosis (By similarity). Regulates hypoxia-enhanced adhesion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to the bone marrow stromal cells via a PLAUR-mediated pathway. This function is mediated by the N-terminal ectodomain (By similarity). Metabolic regulator, which functions to maintain the adequate balance between lipid storage and oxidation in response to changing environmental conditions, such as temperature and diet. The N-terminal ectodomain negatively regulates adipose tissue energy expenditure, acting through the inhibition the BMP/Smad pathway (By similarity). May regulate signaling by the heterodimeric neurotrophic cytokine CLCF1-CRLF1 bound to the CNTFR receptor by promoting the endocytosis of the tripartite complex CLCF1-CRLF1-CNTFR and lysosomal degradation. Might regulate IL6 signaling, decreasing cis signaling, while up-regulating trans signaling (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O88307, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q92673, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21994944, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23333276, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25967121}.",,APOE

E1/E2 heterodimer binds host apolipoproteins such as APOB and APOE thereby forming a lipo-viro-particle (LVP) (PubMed:24838241, PubMed:25122793, PubMed:29695434). APOE associated to the LVP allows the initial virus attachment to cell surface receptors such as the heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), syndecan-1 (SDC1), syndecan-1 (SDC2), the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and scavenger receptor class B type I (SCARB1) (PubMed:12356718, PubMed:12913001, PubMed:12970454, PubMed:22767607, PubMed:28404852). The cholesterol transfer activity of SCARB1 allows E2 exposure and binding of E2 to SCARB1 and the tetraspanin CD81 (PubMed:12913001, PubMed:22767607). E1/E2 heterodimer binding on CD81 activates the epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway (By similarity) (PubMed:12913001, PubMed:12970454, PubMed:19182773, PubMed:20375010, PubMed:22855500, PubMed:24038151). Diffusion of the complex E1/E2-EGFR-SCARB1-CD81 to the cell lateral membrane allows further interaction with Claudin 1 (CLDN1) and occludin (OCLN) to finally trigger HCV entry (By similarity) (PubMed:12913001, PubMed:12970454, PubMed:19182773, PubMed:20375010, PubMed:24038151).

Creates a pore in acidic organelles and releases Ca(2+) and H(+) in the cytoplasm of infected cells, leading to a productive viral infection (Probable) (PubMed:20824094). High levels of cytoplasmic Ca(2+) may trigger membrane trafficking and transport of viral ER-associated proteins to viroplasms, sites of viral genome replication (Probable).

Essential component of the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAP/JNK) signaling pathway. With MAP2K4/MKK4, is the one of the only known kinase to directly activate the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinases MAPK8/JNK1, MAPK9/JNK2 and MAPK10/JNK3. MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7 both activate the JNKs by phosphorylation, but they differ in their preference for the phosphorylation site in the Thr-Pro-Tyr motif. MAP2K4/MKK4 shows preference for phosphorylation of the Tyr residue and MAP2K7/MKK7 for the Thr residue. The monophosphorylation of JNKs on the Thr residue is sufficient to increase JNK activity indicating that MAP2K7/MKK7 is important to trigger JNK activity, while the additional phosphorylation of the Tyr residue by MAP2K4/MKK4 ensures optimal JNK activation. Has a specific role in JNK signal transduction pathway activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. The MKK/JNK signaling pathway is also involved in mitochondrial death signaling pathway, including the release cytochrome c, leading to apoptosis. Part of a non-canonical MAPK signaling pathway, composed of the upstream MAP3K12 kinase and downstream MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1, that enhances the AP-1-mediated transcription of APP in response to APOE (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8CE90, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10051439}.",,APOE

Receptor for bile acids (BAs) such as chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), lithocholic acid, deoxycholic acid (DCA) and allocholic acid (ACA). Plays a essential role in BA homeostasis through the regulation of genes involved in BA synthesis, conjugation and enterohepatic circulation. Also regulates lipid and glucose homeostasis and is involved in innate immune response (PubMed:11030617, PubMed:21383957, PubMed:22820415). The FXR-RXR heterodimer binds predominantly to farnesoid X receptor response elements (FXREs) containing two inverted repeats of the consensus sequence 5'-AGGTCA-3' in which the monomers are spaced by 1 nucleotide (IR-1) but also to tandem repeat DR1 sites with lower affinity, and can be activated by either FXR or RXR-specific ligands. It is proposed that monomeric nuclear receptors such as NR5A2/LRH-1 bound to coregulatory nuclear responsive element (NRE) halfsites located in close proximity to FXREs modulate transcriptional activity (PubMed:20091679, PubMed:20483916). In the liver activates transcription of the corepressor NR0B2 thereby indirectly inhibiting CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 (involved in BA synthesis) implicating at least in part histone demethylase KDM1A resulting in epigenomic repression, and SLC10A1/NTCP (involved in hepatic uptake of conjugated BAs).

In the intestine activates FGF15 expression and secretion leading to hepatic CYP7A1 repression; the function also involves the coordinated induction of hepatic KLB/beta-klotho expression (PubMed:16213224, PubMed:26505219). Transcriptional activation of FABP6/IBAP and SCD1 but not of ABCB11 is isoform-specific (PubMed:12393883). Regulates transcription of liver UGT2B4 and SULT2A1 involved in BA detoxification; binding to the UGT2B4 promoter seems to imply a monomeric transactivation independent of RXRA (By similarity). Modulates lipid homeostasis by activating liver NR0B2/SHP-mediated repression of SREBF1 isoform SREBP-1C (involved in de novo lipogenesis), expression of PLTP (involved in HDL formation), SCARB1 (involved in HDL hepatic uptake), APOE, APOC1, APOC4, VLDLR and SDC1 (involved in the hepatic uptake of LDL and IDL remnants), and inhibiting expression of MTTP (involved in VLDL assembly) (PubMed:12421815, PubMed:15146238). Increases expression of APOC2 (promoting lipoprotein lipase activity implicated in triglyceride clearance) (PubMed:11579204). Transrepresses APOA1 probably involving a monomeric competition with NR2A1 for binding to a DR1 element (PubMed:21804189).

Involved in intestinal innate immunity. Plays a role in protecting the distal small intestine against bacterial overgrowth and preservation of the epithelial barrier (PubMed:16473946, PubMed:21242261). Down-regulates inflammatory cytokine expression in several types of immune cells including macrophages and mononuclear cells (PubMed:19864602).

Receptor for bile acids (BAs) such as chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), lithocholic acid, deoxycholic acid (DCA) and allocholic acid (ACA). Plays a essential role in BA homeostasis through the regulation of genes involved in BA synthesis, conjugation and enterohepatic circulation. Also regulates lipid and glucose homeostasis and is involved innate immune response. The FXR-RXR heterodimer binds predominantly to farnesoid X receptor response elements (FXREs) containing two inverted repeats of the consensus sequence 5'-AGGTCA-3' in which the monomers are spaced by 1 nucleotide (IR-1) but also to tandem repeat DR1 sites with lower affinity, and can be activated by either FXR or RXR-specific ligands. It is proposed that monomeric nuclear receptors such as NR5A2/LRH-1 bound to coregulatory nuclear responsive element (NRE) halfsites located in close proximity to FXREs modulate transcriptional activity. In the liver activates transcription of the corepressor NR0B2 thereby indirectly inhibiting CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 (involved in BA synthesis) implicating at least in part histone demethylase KDM1A resulting in epigenomic repression, and SLC10A1/NTCP (involved in hepatic uptake of conjugated BAs). Activates transcription of the repressor MAFG (involved in regulation of BA synthesis). Activates transcription of SLC27A5/BACS and BAAT (involved in BA conjugation), ABCB11/BSEP (involved in bile salt export) by directly recruiting histone methyltransferase CARM1, and ABCC2/MRP2 (involved in secretion of conjugated BAs) and ABCB4 (involved in secretion of phosphatidylcholine in the small intestine). Activates transcription of SLC27A5/BACS and BAAT (involved in BA conjugation), ABCB11/BSEP (involved in bile salt export) by directly recruiting histone methyltransferase CARM1, and ABCC2/MRP2 (involved in secretion of conjugated BAs) and ABCB4 (involved in secretion of phosphatidylcholine in the small intestine). In the intestine activates FGF19 expression and secretion leading to hepatic CYP7A1 repression. The function also involves the coordinated induction of hepatic KLB/beta-klotho expression. Regulates transcription of liver UGT2B4 and SULT2A1 involved in BA detoxification; binding to the UGT2B4 promoter seems to imply a monomeric transactivation independent of RXRA. Modulates lipid homeostasis by activating liver NR0B2/SHP-mediated repression of SREBF1 (involved in de novo lipogenesis), expression of PLTP (involved in HDL formation), SCARB1 (involved in HDL hepatic uptake), APOE, APOC1, APOC4, PPARA (involved in beta-oxidation of fatty acids), VLDLR and SDC1 (involved in the hepatic uptake of LDL and IDL remnants), and inhibiting expression of MTTP (involved in VLDL assembly). Increases expression of APOC2 (promoting lipoprotein lipase activity implicated in triglyceride clearance). Transrepresses APOA1 involving a monomeric competition with NR2A1 for binding to a DR1 element. Also reduces triglyceride clearance by inhibiting expression of ANGPTL3 and APOC3 (both involved in inhibition of lipoprotein lipase). Involved in glucose homeostasis by modulating hepatic gluconeogenesis through activation of NR0B2/SHP-mediated repression of respective genes. Modulates glycogen synthesis (inducing phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3). Modulates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and is involved in insulin resistance. Involved in intestinal innate immunity. Plays a role in protecting the distal small intestine against bacterial overgrowth and preservation of the epithelial barrier.

Essential component of the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAP/JNK) signaling pathway. With MAP2K4/MKK4, is the one of the only known kinase to directly activate the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinases MAPK8/JNK1, MAPK9/JNK2 and MAPK10/JNK3. MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7 both activate the JNKs by phosphorylation, but they differ in their preference for the phosphorylation site in the Thr-Pro-Tyr motif.

At the plasma membrane, cooperates with LY96 to mediate the innate immune response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (PubMed:20133493, PubMed:9851930, PubMed:9989976). Also involved in LPS-independent inflammatory responses triggered by free fatty acids, such as palmitate, and Ni(2+). Mechanistically, acts via MYD88, TIRAP and TRAF6, leading to NF-kappa-B activation, cytokine secretion and the inflammatory response (PubMed:24380872). Alternatively, CD14-mediated TLR4 internalization via endocytosis is associated with the initiation of a MYD88-independent signaling via the TICAM1-TBK1-IRF3 axis leading to type I interferon production. In addition to the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, initiates the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and formation of a positive feedback loop between autophagy and NF-kappa-B signaling cascade.

Proposed to play a role in the trafficking of energy substrates to either storage or oxidative tissues in response to food intake (By similarity). Has a stimulatory effect on plasma triglycerides (TG), which is achieved by suppressing plasma TG clearance via inhibition of LPL activity. The inhibition of LPL activity appears to be an indirect mechanism involving recruitment of proprotein convertases PCSK6 and FURIN to LPL leading to cleavage and dissociation of LPL from the cell surface; the function does not require ANGPTL3 proteolytic cleavage but seems to be mediated by the N-terminal domain, and is not inhibited by GPIHBP1 (PubMed:12097324, PubMed:19318355, PubMed:20581395). Can inhibit endothelial lipase, causing increased plasma levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and phospholipids (PubMed:17110602, PubMed:19028676). Can bind to adipocytes to activate lipolysis, releasing free fatty acids and glycerol (PubMed:12565906). Suppresses LPL specifically in oxidative tissues which is required to route very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-TG to white adipose tissue (WAT) for storage in response to food; the function may involve cooperation with circulating, liver-derived ANGPTL8 and ANGPTL4 expression in WAT (By similarity). Contributes to lower plasma levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol by a mechanism that is independent of the canonical pathway implicating APOE and LDLR. May stimulate hypothalamic LPL activity (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9R182, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11788823, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12097324, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12565906, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12909640, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17110602, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19028676, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19318355, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20581395, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23661675, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25495645, ECO:0000305|PubMed:20581395}.; FUNCTION: [ANGPTL3(17-221)]: In vitro inhibits LPL activity; not effective on GPIHBP1-stabilized LPL. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19542565}.; FUNCTION: Involved in angiogenesis.

P0DUZ9,APOE_THRSW,Apoe,Apolipoprotein E (Apo-E),Thryonomys swinderianus (Greater cane rat) (African grasscutter),299,"FUNCTION: APOE is an apolipoprotein, a protein associating with lipid particles, that mainly functions in lipoprotein-mediated lipid transport between organs via the plasma and interstitial fluids. APOE is a core component of plasma lipoproteins and is involved in their production, conversion and clearance. Apolipoproteins are amphipathic molecules that interact both with lipids of the lipoprotein particle core and the aqueous environment of the plasma. As such, APOE associates with chylomicrons, chylomicron remnants, very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL) but shows a preferential binding to high-density lipoproteins (HDL). It also binds a wide range of cellular receptors including the LDL receptor/LDLR, the LDL receptor-related proteins LRP1, LRP2 and LRP8 and the very low-density lipoprotein receptor/VLDLR that mediate the cellular uptake of the APOE-containing lipoprotein particles. Finally, APOE also has a heparin-binding activity and binds heparan-sulfate proteoglycans on the surface of cells, a property that supports the capture and the receptor-mediated uptake of APOE-containing lipoproteins by cells. A main function of APOE is to mediate lipoprotein clearance through the uptake of chylomicrons, VLDLs, and HDLs by hepatocytes. APOE is also involved in the biosynthesis by the liver of VLDLs as well as their uptake by peripheral tissues ensuring the delivery of triglycerides and energy storage in muscle, heart and adipose tissues. By participating in the lipoprotein-mediated distribution of lipids among tissues, APOE plays a critical role in plasma and tissues lipid homeostasis. APOE is also involved in two steps of reverse cholesterol transport, the HDLs-mediated transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver, and thereby plays an important role in cholesterol homeostasis.
