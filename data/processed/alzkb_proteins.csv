P02649,APOE_HUMAN,APOE,APOE,Apolipoprotein E (Apo-E),Homo sapiens (Human),317.0,"FUNCTION: APOE is an apolipoprotein, a protein associating with lipid particles, that mainly functions in lipoprotein-mediated lipid transport between organs via the plasma and interstitial fluids (PubMed:14754908, PubMed:1911868, PubMed:6860692). APOE is a core component of plasma lipoproteins and is involved in their production, conversion and clearance (PubMed:14754908, PubMed:1911868, PubMed:1917954, PubMed:23620513, PubMed:2762297, PubMed:6860692, PubMed:9395455). Apolipoproteins are amphipathic molecules that interact both with lipids of the lipoprotein particle core and the aqueous environment of the plasma (PubMed:2762297, PubMed:6860692, PubMed:9395455). As such, APOE associates with chylomicrons, chylomicron remnants, very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL) but shows a preferential binding to high-density lipoproteins (HDL) (PubMed:1911868, PubMed:6860692). It also binds a wide range of cellular receptors including the LDL receptor/LDLR, the LDL receptor-related proteins LRP1, LRP2 and LRP8 and the very low-density lipoprotein receptor/VLDLR that mediate the cellular uptake of the APOE-containing lipoprotein particles (PubMed:12950167, PubMed:1530612, PubMed:1917954, PubMed:20030366, PubMed:20303980, PubMed:2063194, PubMed:2762297, PubMed:7635945, PubMed:7768901, PubMed:8756331, PubMed:8939961). Finally, APOE also has a heparin-binding activity and binds heparan-sulfate proteoglycans on the surface of cells, a property that supports the capture and the receptor-mediated uptake of APOE-containing lipoproteins by cells (PubMed:23676495, PubMed:7635945, PubMed:9395455, PubMed:9488694). A main function of APOE is to mediate lipoprotein clearance through the uptake of chylomicrons, VLDLs, and HDLs by hepatocytes (PubMed:1911868, PubMed:1917954, PubMed:23676495, PubMed:29516132, PubMed:9395455). APOE is also involved in the biosynthesis by the liver of VLDLs as well as their uptake by peripheral tissues ensuring the delivery of triglycerides and energy storage in muscle, heart and adipose tissues (PubMed:2762297, PubMed:29516132). By participating in the lipoprotein-mediated distribution of lipids among tissues, APOE plays a critical role in plasma and tissues lipid homeostasis (PubMed:1917954, PubMed:2762297, PubMed:29516132). APOE is also involved in two steps of reverse cholesterol transport, the HDLs-mediated transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver, and thereby plays an important role in cholesterol homeostasis (PubMed:14754908, PubMed:23620513, PubMed:9395455). First, it is functionally associated with ABCA1 in the biogenesis of HDLs in tissues (PubMed:14754908, PubMed:23620513). Second, it is enriched in circulating HDLs and mediates their uptake by hepatocytes (PubMed:9395455). APOE also plays an important role in lipid transport in the central nervous system, regulating neuron survival and sprouting (PubMed:25173806, PubMed:8939961). APOE is also involved in innate and adaptive immune responses, controlling for instance the survival of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (By similarity). Binds to the immune cell receptor LILRB4 (PubMed:30333625). APOE may also play a role in transcription regulation through a receptor-dependent and cholesterol-independent mechanism, that activates MAP3K12 and a non-canonical MAPK signal transduction pathway that results in enhanced AP-1-mediated transcription of APP (PubMed:28111074). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P08226, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12950167, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14754908, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1530612, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1911868, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1917954, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20030366, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20303980, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2063194, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23620513, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23676495, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2762297, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28111074, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30333625, ECO:0000269|PubMed:6860692, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7635945, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7768901, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8756331, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8939961, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9395455, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9488694, ECO:0000303|PubMed:25173806, ECO:0000303|PubMed:29516132}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Through its interaction with HCV envelope glycoprotein E2, participates in the attachment of HCV to HSPGs and other receptors (LDLr, VLDLr, and SR-B1) on the cell surface and to the assembly, maturation and infectivity of HCV viral particles (PubMed:25122793, PubMed:29695434).

They are Congo red negative and lack the dense amyloid cores commonly present in Alzheimer disease. Some affected individuals manifest progressive aphasic dementia, leukoencephalopathy, and occipital calcifications. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11409420, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12654973, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16178030, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20697050, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2111584}.

Acts as a key regulator of glucose homeostasis in liver by phosphorylating CRTC2/TORC2, leading to CRTC2/TORC2 sequestration in the cytoplasm (By similarity). In response to stress, phosphorylates 'Ser-36' of histone H2B (H2BS36ph), leading to promote transcription (By similarity). Acts as a key regulator of cell growth and proliferation by phosphorylating FNIP1, TSC2, RPTOR, WDR24 and ATG1/ULK1: in response to nutrient limitation, negatively regulates the mTORC1 complex by phosphorylating RPTOR component of the mTORC1 complex and by phosphorylating and activating TSC2 (PubMed:14651849, PubMed:18439900, PubMed:20160076, PubMed:21205641). Also phosphorylates and inhibits GATOR2 subunit WDR24 in response to nutrient limitation, leading to suppress glucose-mediated mTORC1 activation (PubMed:36732624). In response to energetic stress, phosphorylates FNIP1, inactivating the non-canonical mTORC1 signaling, thereby promoting nuclear translocation of TFEB and TFE3, and inducing transcription of lysosomal or autophagy genes (PubMed:37079666). In response to nutrient limitation, promotes autophagy by phosphorylating and activating ATG1/ULK1 (PubMed:21205641). In that process, it also activates WDR45/WIPI4 (PubMed:28561066). Phosphorylates CASP6, thereby preventing its autoprocessing and subsequent activation (PubMed:32029622). In response to nutrient limitation, phosphorylates transcription factor FOXO3 promoting FOXO3 mitochondrial import (By similarity). Also acts as a regulator of cellular polarity by remodeling the actin cytoskeleton; probably by indirectly activating myosin (PubMed:17486097). AMPK also acts as a regulator of circadian rhythm by mediating phosphorylation of CRY1, leading to destabilize it (By similarity). May regulate the Wnt signaling pathway by phosphorylating CTNNB1, leading to stabilize it (By similarity). Also has tau-protein kinase activity: in response to amyloid beta A4 protein (APP) exposure, activated by CAMKK2, leading to phosphorylation of MAPT/TAU; however the relevance of such data remains unclear in vivo (By similarity). Also phosphorylates CFTR, EEF2K, KLC1, NOS3 and SLC12A1 (PubMed:12519745, PubMed:20074060). Regulates hepatic lipogenesis. Activated via SIRT3, represses sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcriptional activities and ATP-consuming lipogenesis to restore cellular energy balance. Upon stress, regulates mitochondrial fragmentation through phosphorylation of MTFR1L (PubMed:36367943). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P54645, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q5EG47, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11518699, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11554766, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12519745, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14651849, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15866171, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17486097, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17711846, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18184930, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18439900, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20074060, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20160076, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21205641, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24563466, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28561066, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32029622, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34077757, ECO:0000269|PubMed:36367943, ECO:0000269|PubMed:36732624, ECO:0000269|PubMed:37079666, ECO:0000269|PubMed:37821951, ECO:0000303|PubMed:17307971, ECO:0000303|PubMed:17712357}.",

It binds to TRPV1 in an open state-dependent manner, trapping it there to produce irreversible currents (PubMed:20510930, PubMed:26880553, PubMed:27281200). It binds to the outer edge of the external pore of TRPV1 in a counterclockwise configuration, using a limited protein-protein interface and inserting hydrophobic residues into the bilayer (PubMed:26880553, PubMed:27281200). It also partitions naturally into membranes, with the two lobes exhibiting opposing energetics for membrane partitioning (K1) and channel activation (K2) (PubMed:26880553). In addition, the toxin disrupts a cluster of hydrophobic residues behind the selectivity filter that are critical for channel activation (PubMed:26880553). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20510930, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26880553, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27281200}.",
