Through its action on intimal smooth muscle cells and macrophages, may accelerate intimal thickening and macrophage foam cell formation in the process of atherosclerosis (By similarity). Regulates hypoxia-enhanced adhesion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to the bone marrow stromal cells via a PLAUR-mediated pathway. This function is mediated by the N-terminal ectodomain (PubMed:23486467). Metabolic regulator, which functions to maintain the adequate balance between lipid storage and oxidation in response to changing environmental conditions, such as temperature and diet.

P02649,Apolipoprotein E (Apo-E),APOE,Homo sapiens (Human),"FUNCTION: APOE is an apolipoprotein, a protein associating with lipid particles, that mainly functions in lipoprotein-mediated lipid transport between organs via the plasma and interstitial fluids (PubMed:14754908, PubMed:1911868, PubMed:6860692). APOE is a core component of plasma lipoproteins and is involved in their production, conversion and clearance (PubMed:14754908, PubMed:1911868, PubMed:1917954, PubMed:23620513, PubMed:2762297, PubMed:6860692, PubMed:9395455). Apolipoproteins are amphipathic molecules that interact both with lipids of the lipoprotein particle core and the aqueous environment of the plasma (PubMed:2762297, PubMed:6860692, PubMed:9395455). As such, APOE associates with chylomicrons, chylomicron remnants, very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL) but shows a preferential binding to high-density lipoproteins (HDL) (PubMed:1911868, PubMed:6860692). It also binds a wide range of cellular receptors including the LDL receptor/LDLR, the LDL receptor-related proteins LRP1, LRP2 and LRP8 and the very low-density lipoprotein receptor/VLDLR that mediate the cellular uptake of the APOE-containing lipoprotein particles (PubMed:12950167, PubMed:1530612, PubMed:1917954, PubMed:20030366, PubMed:20303980, PubMed:2063194, PubMed:2762297, PubMed:7635945, PubMed:7768901, PubMed:8756331, PubMed:8939961). Finally, APOE also has a heparin-binding activity and binds heparan-sulfate proteoglycans on the surface of cells, a property that supports the capture and the receptor-mediated uptake of APOE-containing lipoproteins by cells (PubMed:23676495, PubMed:7635945, PubMed:9395455, PubMed:9488694). A main function of APOE is to mediate lipoprotein clearance through the uptake of chylomicrons, VLDLs, and HDLs by hepatocytes (PubMed:1911868, PubMed:1917954, PubMed:23676495, PubMed:29516132, PubMed:9395455). APOE is also involved in the biosynthesis by the liver of VLDLs as well as their uptake by peripheral tissues ensuring the delivery of triglycerides and energy storage in muscle, heart and adipose tissues (PubMed:2762297, PubMed:29516132). By participating in the lipoprotein-mediated distribution of lipids among tissues, APOE plays a critical role in plasma and tissues lipid homeostasis (PubMed:1917954, PubMed:2762297, PubMed:29516132). APOE is also involved in two steps of reverse cholesterol transport, the HDLs-mediated transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver, and thereby plays an important role in cholesterol homeostasis (PubMed:14754908, PubMed:23620513, PubMed:9395455). First, it is functionally associated with ABCA1 in the biogenesis of HDLs in tissues (PubMed:14754908, PubMed:23620513). Second, it is enriched in circulating HDLs and mediates their uptake by hepatocytes (PubMed:9395455). APOE also plays an important role in lipid transport in the central nervous system, regulating neuron survival and sprouting (PubMed:25173806, PubMed:8939961). APOE is also involved in innate and adaptive immune responses, controlling for instance the survival of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (By similarity). Binds to the immune cell receptor LILRB4 (PubMed:30333625). APOE may also play a role in transcription regulation through a receptor-dependent and cholesterol-independent mechanism, that activates MAP3K12 and a non-canonical MAPK signal transduction pathway that results in enhanced AP-1-mediated transcription of APP (PubMed:28111074). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P08226, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12950167, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14754908, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1530612, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1911868, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1917954, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20030366, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20303980, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2063194, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23620513, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23676495, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2762297, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28111074, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30333625, ECO:0000269|PubMed:6860692, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7635945, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7768901, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8756331, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8939961, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9395455, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9488694, ECO:0000303|PubMed:25173806, ECO:0000303|PubMed:29516132}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Through its interaction with HCV envelope glycoprotein E2, participates in the attachment of HCV to HSPGs and other receptors (LDLr, VLDLr, and SR-B1) on the cell surface and to the assembly, maturation and infectivity of HCV viral particles (PubMed:25122793, PubMed:29695434).

Partially redundant with PLD4, can cleave all four nucleotides displaying higher efficiency for ssDNA and RNA fragments initiated with uridine and guanosine residues and lower efficiency for cytidine-initiated substrates (PubMed:30111894, PubMed:30312375, PubMed:34620855, PubMed:37225734, PubMed:37994783, PubMed:38537643, PubMed:38697119). As a result, it does not always degrade polynucleotides to the single nucleotide level, it can stall at specific sites sparing certain fragments from exonucleolytic degradation (PubMed:30111894, PubMed:30312375, PubMed:34620855, PubMed:37225734, PubMed:37994783, PubMed:38537643, PubMed:38697119). Processes self and pathogenic ssDNA and RNA molecules that reach the endolysosomal compartment via phagocytosis or autophagy and may serve as 'danger' signals for recognition by innate immune receptors such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) (PubMed:34620855, PubMed:37225734, PubMed:38697119). Degrades mitochondrial CpG-rich ssDNA fragments to prevent TLR9 activation and autoinflammatory response, but it can cleave viral RNA to generate ligands for TLR7 activation and initiate antiviral immune responses (PubMed:34620855, PubMed:37225734, PubMed:38697119). In plasmacytoid dendritic cells, it cooperates with endonuclease RNASET2 to release 2',3'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (2',3'-cGMP), a potent stimulatory ligand for TLR7 (PubMed:34620855, PubMed:37225734, PubMed:38697119). Produces 2',3'-cGMPs and cytidine-rich RNA fragments that occupy TLR7 ligand-binding pockets and trigger a signaling-competent state (PubMed:34620855, PubMed:37225734, PubMed:38697119). Can exert polynucleotide phosphatase activity toward 5'-phosphorylated ssDNA substrates although at a slow rate (PubMed:38537643). Transphosphatidylase that catalyzes the exchange with R to S stereo-inversion of the glycerol moiety between (S,R)-lysophosphatidylglycerol (LPG) and monoacylglycerol (MAG) substrates to yield (S,S)-bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) (PubMed:39423811). Can synthesize a variety of (S,S)-BMPs representing the main phospholipid constituent of lysosomal intralumenal vesicle (ILV) membranes that bind acid hydrolases for lipid degradation (PubMed:39423811).

Plays a role in Notch and Wnt signaling cascades and regulation of downstream processes via its role in processing key regulatory proteins, and by regulating cytosolic CTNNB1 levels (PubMed:10593990, PubMed:10811883, PubMed:10899933, PubMed:9738936). Stimulates cell-cell adhesion via its interaction with CDH1; this stabilizes the complexes between CDH1 (E-cadherin) and its interaction partners CTNNB1 (beta-catenin), CTNND1 and JUP (gamma-catenin) (PubMed:11953314). Under conditions of apoptosis or calcium influx, cleaves CDH1 (PubMed:11953314). This promotes the disassembly of the complexes between CDH1 and CTNND1, JUP and CTNNB1, increases the pool of cytoplasmic CTNNB1, and thereby negatively regulates Wnt signaling (PubMed:11953314, PubMed:9738936).

The SPT complex is composed of SPTLC1, SPTLC2 or SPTLC3 and SPTSSA or SPTSSB. Within this complex, the heterodimer consisting of SPTLC1 and SPTLC2/SPTLC3 forms the catalytic core (PubMed:19416851). The composition of the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) complex determines the substrate preference (PubMed:19416851). The SPTLC1-SPTLC2-SPTSSA complex shows a strong preference for C16-CoA substrate, while the SPTLC1-SPTLC3-SPTSSA isozyme uses both C14-CoA and C16-CoA as substrates, with a slight preference for C14-CoA (PubMed:19416851, PubMed:19648650). The SPTLC1-SPTLC2-SPTSSB complex shows a strong preference for C18-CoA substrate, while the SPTLC1-SPTLC3-SPTSSB isozyme displays an ability to use a broader range of acyl-CoAs, without apparent preference (PubMed:19416851, PubMed:19648650).

P21554,Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB-R) (CB1) (CANN6),CNR1 CNR,Homo sapiens (Human),"FUNCTION: G-protein coupled receptor for endogenous cannabinoids (eCBs), including N-arachidonoylethanolamide (also called anandamide or AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), as well as phytocannabinoids, such as delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (PubMed:15620723, PubMed:27768894, PubMed:27851727). Mediates many cannabinoid-induced effects, acting, among others, on food intake, memory loss, gastrointestinal motility, catalepsy, ambulatory activity, anxiety, chronic pain. Signaling typically involves reduction in cyclic AMP (PubMed:1718258, PubMed:21895628, PubMed:27768894). In the hypothalamus, may have a dual effect on mitochondrial respiration depending upon the agonist dose and possibly upon the cell type. Increases respiration at low doses, while decreases respiration at high doses. At high doses, CNR1 signal transduction involves G-protein alpha-i protein activation and subsequent inhibition of mitochondrial soluble adenylate cyclase, decrease in cyclic AMP concentration, inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation of specific subunits of the mitochondrial electron transport system, including NDUFS2. In the hypothalamus, inhibits leptin-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and mediates cannabinoid-induced increase in SREBF1 and FASN gene expression. In response to cannabinoids, drives the release of orexigenic beta-endorphin, but not that of melanocyte-stimulating hormone alpha/alpha-MSH, from hypothalamic POMC neurons, hence promoting food intake. In the hippocampus, regulates cellular respiration and energy production in response to cannabinoids. Involved in cannabinoid-dependent depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI), a process in which depolarization of CA1 postsynaptic pyramidal neurons mobilizes eCBs, which retrogradely activate presynaptic CB1 receptors, transiently decreasing GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission. Also reduces excitatory synaptic transmission (By similarity). In superior cervical ganglions and cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells, inhibits voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels in a constitutive, as well as agonist-dependent manner (PubMed:17895407). In cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells, cannabinoid-induced inhibition of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels leads to vasodilation and decreased vascular tone (By similarity). Induces leptin production in adipocytes and reduces LRP2-mediated leptin clearance in the kidney, hence participating in hyperleptinemia. In adipose tissue, CNR1 signaling leads to increased expression of SREBF1, ACACA and FASN genes (By similarity). In the liver, activation by endocannabinoids leads to increased de novo lipogenesis and reduced fatty acid catabolism, associated with increased expression of SREBF1/SREBP-1, GCK, ACACA, ACACB and FASN genes. May also affect de novo cholesterol synthesis and HDL-cholesteryl ether uptake. Peripherally modulates energy metabolism (By similarity). In high carbohydrate diet-induced obesity, may decrease the expression of mitochondrial dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase/DLD in striated muscles, as well as that of selected glucose/ pyruvate metabolic enzymes, hence affecting energy expenditure through mitochondrial metabolism (By similarity). In response to cannabinoid anandamide, elicits a pro-inflammatory response in macrophages, which involves NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL1B and IL18 secretion (By similarity). In macrophages infiltrating pancreatic islets, this process may participate in the progression of type-2 diabetes and associated loss of pancreatic beta-cells (PubMed:23955712). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O02777, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P47746, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15620723, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1718258, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17895407, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21895628, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23955712, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27768894, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27851727}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 1]: Binds both 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and anandamide. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15620723}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 2]: Only binds 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) with high affinity.

In Parkinson disease, low CNR1 expression in mid-superior frontal gyrus and mid-cingulate cortex has been associated with poor mind, poor executive functioning and poor episode memory, while patients with more severe visuospatial dysfunction showed decreased receptor availability in the precuneus, mid-cingulate, supplementary motor cortex, inferior orbitofrontal gyrus and thalamus (PubMed:31342135). In an animal model for Alzheimer disease, CNR1 heterozygous deletion has been associated with decreased levels of postsynaptic density protein 95 (DLG4/PSD95) and accelerated memory impairment, suggesting synaptic dysfunction and a crucial role for CNR1 in the progression of disease symptoms (PubMed:10828533, PubMed:19524019, PubMed:30096288, PubMed:31342135, PubMed:8255419). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10828533, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19524019, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30096288, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31342135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32549916, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8255419}.",UniProt,2026-01-05T01:02:46.025118

In vitro, copper-metallated APP induces neuronal death directly or is potentiated through Cu(2+)-mediated low-density lipoprotein oxidation (By similarity). Can regulate neurite outgrowth through binding to components of the extracellular matrix such as heparin and collagen I and IV. Induces a AGER-dependent pathway that involves activation of p38 MAPK, resulting in internalization of amyloid-beta peptide and mitochondrial dysfunction in cultured cortical neurons. Provides Cu(2+) ions for GPC1 which are required for release of nitric oxide (NO) and subsequent degradation of the heparan sulfate chains on GPC1 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P05067}.; FUNCTION: Amyloid-beta peptides are lipophilic metal chelators with metal-reducing activity.

Some APP accumulates in secretory transport vesicles leaving the late Golgi compartment and returns to the cell surface. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P05067}.; SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: [Soluble APP-beta]: Secreted {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P05067}.; SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: [Amyloid-beta protein 42]: Cell surface {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P05067}.

P46089,G-protein coupled receptor 3 (ACCA orphan receptor),GPR3 ACCA,Homo sapiens (Human),"FUNCTION: Constitutively active G-protein coupled receptor that maintains high 3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels that a plays a role in serveral processes including meiotic arrest in oocytes or neuronal development via activation of numerous intracellular signaling pathways. Acts as an essential activator of thermogenic adipocytes and drives thermogenesis via its intrinsic G(s)-coupling activity without the requirement of a ligand (PubMed:34048700). Has a potential role in modulating a number of brain functions, including behavioral responses to stress (By similarity), amyloid-beta peptide generation in neurons (By similarity). Stimulates neurite outgrowth in cerebellar granular neurons modulated via PKA, ERK, and most strongly PI3K-mediated signaling pathways (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P35413, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19213921, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34048700}.",SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; Multi-pass membrane protein.,,UniProt,2026-01-05T01:02:46.025118
